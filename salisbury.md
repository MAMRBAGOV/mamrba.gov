# Salisbury

Salisbury’s beaches and riverfront areas play an important role in regional recreation, tourism, and coastal protection. Through the Merrimack River Beach Alliance, Salisbury works with neighboring communities to improve access, protect dunes and marshes, and strengthen resilience against storms and flooding.

Projects in Salisbury focus on:
- Improving beach access and facilities  
- Protecting coastal and riverfront habitats  
- Enhancing public safety and visitor experience
