     Salisbury’s beaches and riverfront areas play an important role in regional recreation, tourism, and coastal protection. Through the Merrimack River Beach Alliance, Salisbury works with neighboring communities to improve access, protect dunes and marshes, and strengthen resilience against storms and flooding.
