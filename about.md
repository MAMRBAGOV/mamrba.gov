# About the Merrimack River Beach Alliance

The Merrimack River Beach Alliance (MRBA) is a regional partnership formed by Salisbury, Newbury, and Newburyport to coordinate beach and shoreline improvements across town boundaries.

Our beaches and waterfronts are connected by geography, environment, and public use. Storms, erosion, sea level rise, and changing recreation patterns do not stop at municipal borders — and neither should our solutions.

By working together, the three communities can:
- Share data and planning resources  
- Apply jointly for state and federal grants  
- Coordinate construction and improvements  
- Reduce costs and duplication  
- Create a consistent, high-quality public experience  

MRBA works closely with state and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and coastal experts to make sure our projects are well-designed, resilient, and environmentally responsible.
