# Merrimack River Beach Alliance (MRBA)

Welcome to the Merrimack River Beach Alliance — a regional partnership of Salisbury, Newbury, and Newburyport working together with state and federal agencies to protect, improve, and enhance the beaches and shoreline along the Merrimack River and surrounding coast.

Our beaches are a shared resource. They support local communities, tourism, wildlife habitat, and coastal resilience. By working together across town boundaries, we can make smarter investments, plan for the future, and create a safer, more accessible shoreline for everyone.
