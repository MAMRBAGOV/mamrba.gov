# The Beaches

The Merrimack River and surrounding coastline include a mix of sandy beaches, dunes, marshes, and waterfront parks. These areas provide recreation, wildlife habitat, and natural protection from storms.

MRBA works to make sure these beaches remain:
- Safe  
- Accessible  
- Environmentally healthy  
- Resilient to climate change
